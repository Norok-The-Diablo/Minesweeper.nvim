Play Minesweeper in Neovim: because if Emacs has taught us anything, it's that
text editors are for gaming!

Requires Neovim version 0.7 or above.
## How to play

Install it using your favourite package manager like any other plugin. For instance 
```Plug 'Norok-The-Diablo/minesweeper.nvim'``` 
run it with
```:Minesweeper```

- Press `!` to flag a square.
- Press `?` to mark a square for later.
- Press `<Space>` or `<RightMouse>` to cycle between `!`, `?` and unmarking a
  square.
- Press `<CR>`, `x` or `<LeftMouse>` to reveal a square; just try not to step on
  a mine!

Run `:help minesweeper.nvim` for more details.
